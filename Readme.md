Repository to debug the discrepencies between MPI and OpenMPi, so that MPI code can be "modified" to run on an OpenMPI cluster

working_ompi_code.c Contains some basic OpenMPI code pulled from stack overflow; this code runs on my current cluster configuration
the output of said code is included as a screenshot labeled "WorkingOutput.png"
